## 15.6 Polymorphism and Virtual Member Functions

###### Polymorphism
 - Pr15-10 PassFailActivity
 - Pr15-11 getLetterGrade() virtual function in PassFailActivity
 - Pr15-12 

###### Polymorphism Requires References or Pointers
 - Pr15-13

###### Base Class Pointers
 - Pr15-14

###### Base Class Pointers and References Know Only About Base Class Members 
###### The “Is-a” Relationship Does Not Work in Reverse 
###### Redefining vs. Overriding
###### Virtual Destructor
 - Pr15-15
 - Pr15-16

###### C++ 11’s override and final Key Words
 - Pr15-17
 - Pr15-18

###### Preventing a Member Function from Being Overridden

## 15.7 Abstract Base Classes and Pure Virtual Functions
